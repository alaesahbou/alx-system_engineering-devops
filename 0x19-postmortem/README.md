# Postmortem: When the Load Balancer Went on a Coffee Break ☕️

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: From 2024-04-10 09:00 AM to 2024-04-10 11:30 AM (UTC).
- **Impact**:
  - The API service decided to take a nap, affecting 30% of users who were left waiting at the virtual door.
  - Users experienced cryptic error messages reminiscent of ancient hieroglyphics.

## Root Cause
The load balancer, tired of being in the shadow of servers, decided to rebel with a misconfiguration stunt, leading to chaos in the system.

## Timeline
- **Detection**:
  - 09:00 AM: An engineer received a frantic monitoring alert, as if the servers were shouting, "Houston, we have a problem!"
- **Actions Taken**:
  - 09:05 AM: The engineering team embarked on a treasure hunt through server logs and configuration files, searching for the elusive culprit.
  - 09:15 AM: Briefly distracted by a wild goose chase into database servers, hoping to find a clue hidden in the data haystack.
  - 09:30 AM: The load balancer misconfiguration was unmasked, revealing its mischievous nature.
- **Escalation**:
  - 10:00 AM: The incident escalated to the DevOps team, armed with coffee and determination.
- **Resolution**:
  - 11:30 AM: With a stroke of genius (and a few keystrokes), the load balancer was put back in line, and harmony returned to the API service.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Cause**:
  - The load balancer, tired of being overlooked, decided to hog all the traffic, causing a traffic jam and subsequent service outage.
- **Resolution**:
  - The load balancer's ego was gently massaged with corrected settings, reminding it of its duty to share the workload.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement a "Coffee Break Alert" system for load balancers to avoid future rebellions.
  - Enhance monitoring to detect load balancer antics early, before they turn into full-blown outages.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct a load balancer therapy session, reminding it of its importance in the server ecosystem.
  - Update incident response protocols to include load balancer tantrums in the playbook.
