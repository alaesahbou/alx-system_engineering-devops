**Issue Summary**
- **Duration**: The outage occurred from 2024-04-10 09:00 AM to 2024-04-10 11:30 AM (UTC).
- **Impact**:
  - The API service was down, affecting 30% of users who were unable to access critical features.
  - Users experienced error messages when trying to perform actions through the API.

**Root Cause**
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to a bottleneck that caused the API service to become unresponsive.

**Timeline**
- **Detection**:
  - 09:00 AM: An engineer received a monitoring alert indicating high latency in API responses.
- **Actions Taken**:
  - 09:05 AM: The engineering team began investigating the issue, focusing on the load balancer configuration.
  - 09:15 AM: Initial assumptions suggested a possible database performance issue, leading to a brief investigation into database servers.
  - 09:30 AM: Realizing the load balancer misconfiguration, efforts shifted to rectifying the settings.
- **Escalation**:
  - 10:00 AM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further analysis and resolution.
- **Resolution**:
  - 11:30 AM: The load balancer settings were corrected, restoring normal functionality to the API service.

**Root Cause and Resolution**
- **Cause**:
  - The misconfigured load balancer resulted in traffic not being distributed evenly, causing a bottleneck and subsequent service outage.
- **Resolution**:
  - The load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute incoming requests among backend servers, resolving the bottleneck issue.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement regular audits of load balancer configurations to catch and rectify potential issues.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to provide early detection of load-related problems.
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct a thorough review of all load balancer configurations and document best practices for future reference.
  - Update incident response protocols to include specific steps for addressing load balancer-related outages.
